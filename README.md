## Prerequisite
Fork this repository to your own repository.

## Setup Guide
Clone the forked repository to your system using GUI tools or command line 
```
git clone <your_repository_url> <directory_to_clone_to>
```

Copy `.env.example` and rename as a new file as `.env`

Open the `.env` file and update the variable to your own variable and do not forget to set the following:
```

```
>This will be the default admin user and developer user that will be seeded into the database.
*By default only `DEVELOPER_USER_SEED_EMAIL` can access to telescope module*

After setting your `.env` file, run: 
```
composer install
```

After composer install finish, run the following command to set application key.
```
php artisan key:generate
```

Then run migration command and seed the database.
```
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Next, run the following command to setup `Passport` and `Telescope`
```
php artisan passport:install --uuids
php artisan telescope:install
```
> After running ```php artisan telescope:install```, you should see `app\Providers` being created and inside there will be `TelescopeServiceProvider` file. Please delete the folder as this has been moved to `app\Web\Providers`
